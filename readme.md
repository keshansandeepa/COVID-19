# COVID-19 Backend Services

## Contributing
Please keep the following in mind when submitting your valuable contributions üòä
- Currently, all development is happening out of the master branch, so kindly fork it and make your changes there before submitting a PR.
- If you've implemented a new API, update the readme and [postman collection](../master/postman/COVID-19.postman_collection.json). This makes it so much easier for other developers to consume your APIs.
- Rebase your code before submitting PRs: `git pull --rebase upstream master` ensures there are no conflicts and keeps the tree clean!
- Comments are always encouraged - you never know who'll continue to work on your code next, so let's make their life a bit easier shall we üòâ
- Finally, see something wrong or have a suggestion? raise an [issue](https://github.com/azhamn/COVID-19/issues) so we can get working on it right away!

# How to Start The Application as a Service (Ubuntu)

## Step 1 Create a Service
- *covid-19* : Customizable 
```bash
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/covid-19.service
```
Copy/paste the following into the file `/etc/systemd/system/covid-19.service`
- *WorkingDirectory* : The directory of the application
- *ExecStart* : The bash script path to start the application
```bash
[Unit]
# Description of the service
Description= COVID-19 Service
[Service]
# The user that should run the service 
User=green
# The configuration file application.properties should be here:
# Change this to your workspace
WorkingDirectory=/home/green/app-service-test
#path to executable. 
#executable is a bash script which calls jar file
ExecStart=/home/green/app-service-test/service
SuccessExitStatus=143
TimeoutStopSec=10
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Step 2: Create a Bash Script to Call The Service
- *covid19-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar* : jar file name
```bash
#!/bin/sh
/usr/bin/java -jar covid19-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server application.yml
```
Give your script execute permission:
```bash
sudo chmod u+x service
```

## Step 3: Enable/Start/Stop the Service

Enable
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable covid-19.service
```

start
```bash
sudo systemctl start covid-19
```

status
```bash
sudo systemctl status covid-19
```
stop
```bash
sudo systemctl stop covid-19
```

## Getting started

### Setting up Build system
- In order to Setup You need to Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies. 
- Now Run `npm run watch`.
- All of the following folders are monitored for changes, which will tell the browser to reload automatically after any changes are made:
`Resources>Js`
-Now you can edit any html file inside the resource.

- Hit Ctrl+C or just close the command line window to stop the server.
